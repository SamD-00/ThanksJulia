        <p>Julia,<br></p><p id="msg" style="text-indent: 2em;">Thank you for the
             really special date.
            You really care about me and it shows. You managed to get in all of my
             favorite things in one day! Steak, Space, and you. They say the vacuum
             of space smells like steak. My handwriting is so bad I figured the most
              logical fix would be to make a website thank you card. Also, I can add 
              cool features. If you haven't noticed by now, if you move finger around on
               the screen, there's a confeti trail! So cool. It might be cool or it might
                break your phone because of my sub-optimal programming skills. Anyways 
                back to the plot. I am so lucky to have a girl like you in my life. You 
                always make me feel so special. I am very much looking forward to spending
                 many more birthdays with you (but only if there is steak involed).<br><br>I love
                 you always Julia,<br><br>-Sammy
